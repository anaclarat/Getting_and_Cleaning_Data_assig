# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_assig

This repo is the submission of anaclarat's Johns Hopkins/Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project assignment.

The data set involves data collected of Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones.
The files within this repo are:
1. CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformationsperformed to clean up the data
2. run_analysis.R downloads data and prepared it to perform the 5 steps described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
    2.1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2.2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    2.3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    2.4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    2.5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

    TidyData1.txt and TidyData2 are the exported. TidyData1.txt is the data after step 4 and TidyData2.tx after going through all the steps described above.
